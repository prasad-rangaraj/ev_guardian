# EV Guardian 🔋
**AI-Powered Battery Safety Intelligence Platform**

*Detect Early. Act Smart. Stay Safe.*

## 📖 Application Description

EV Guardian AI is a unified Edge AI-powered vehicle safety platform that continuously monitors the battery, driver, vehicle health, and surrounding environment to predict risks before they become failures.

Unlike traditional Battery Management Systems (BMS) that only display battery parameters, EV Guardian combines predictive battery intelligence, driver monitoring, computer vision, and on-device AI reasoning into a single real-time safety ecosystem running entirely on Qualcomm Snapdragon Edge AI platforms.

The platform performs AI inference locally using the CPU, GPU, and NPU, enabling ultra-low latency decisions without depending on cloud connectivity. By integrating Battery State-of-Health (SOH), Remaining Useful Life (RUL), sensor trust validation, driver drowsiness detection, blind-spot monitoring, and an on-device multilingual AI assistant, EV Guardian provides proactive safety instead of reactive alerts.

## 🚀 Setup & Installation Instructions

This project is divided into three main components, each optimized for different Qualcomm platforms. Follow these instructions to set them up from scratch.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js (v18+)
- Android Studio
- Git

### 1. Web Dashboard & Server (`Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite pc`)
This handles the web UI, the backend server, and the built-in telemetry simulator.

```bash
# Navigate to the server folder
cd "Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite pc/server"

# Create a virtual environment and activate it
python -m venv venv
# On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# On Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

# Install backend dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the Python server
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 3001
```

To run the React Frontend Dashboard:
```bash
# Open a new terminal and navigate to the client folder
cd "Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite pc/client"

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
# Or for the electron app: npm run electron:dev
```

### 2. Edge AI & Battery Engine (`Qualcomm Arduino Uno Q`)
This folder contains the locally running edge models: the AI driver monitor and the optimized integrated BMS engine.

**Driver Drowsiness Monitor:**
```bash
cd "Qualcomm Arduino Uno Q/driver_monitor"
python -m venv venv
# Activate the venv (.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python monitor.py
```

**Integrated BMS Engine (Optimized):**
```bash
cd "Qualcomm Arduino Uno Q/integrated_bms_engine(optimised)"
python -m venv venv
# Activate the venv (.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_engine.py
```
*(The BMS Engine will automatically listen to MQTT data over WebSocket and run real-time inference on the edge).*

### 3. Native Android App (`OnePlus 15`)
To run the Android app companion:

1. Open **Android Studio**.
2. Click **Open** and select the `Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile/client/app` folder.
3. Wait for Gradle to sync automatically.
4. Set up an Android Emulator or plug in a physical Android phone via USB (Recommended for ARM/Copilot+ PCs).
5. Click the green **Run** button at the top right of Android Studio.

> **Note:** If testing on a physical device, ensure the `SERVER_URL` in `BmsViewModel.kt` is set to your computer's local Wi-Fi IP address (e.g., `192.168.x.x`) instead of `localhost`.

## 🧠 AI Models & APIs Used

### 1. Local Edge AI (NPU) - GenieX
The Web Dashboard chatbot is powered by a local, offline LLM running on the Snapdragon NPU using **GenieX**. GenieX is a high-performance edge AI inference engine designed for running LLMs efficiently on consumer hardware.

#### GenieX Installation Process
To use the local AI features, you must install the GenieX CLI tool:
1. Download the latest release from the [GenieX GitHub Repository / Official Website](https://github.com/geniex/geniex) or install it via npm:
   ```bash
   npm install -g geniex-cli
   ```
2. Make sure it is added to your system `PATH` so you can use the `geniex` command globally.

- **LLM Model:** `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-Instruct-GGUF:q4_k_m` (Configured in `.env`) 
- *Note: You can also use the larger `bartowski/Qwen_Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-GGUF:q4_k_m` if your device has enough RAM.*

To run the inference server:
```bash
# This command automatically downloads the GGUF model and loads it into memory
geniex infer Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-Instruct-GGUF:q4_k_m

# Starts the local API server mimicking OpenAI format
geniex serve --host 127.0.0.1:8080
```
*(Ensure `.env` is configured with `GENIEX_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions"` and `AI_MODEL`)*

### 2. Sarvam AI (Voice & Translation APIs)
The web chat interface utilizes Sarvam AI's cutting-edge APIs for seamless voice interactions and multilingual support:
- **Speech-To-Text (STT):** `saaras:v3`
- **Text-To-Speech (TTS):** `bulbul:v3`
- **Translation:** `mayura:v1`

### 3. Qualcomm AI Hub (Driver Monitor)
The driver drowsiness monitor runs locally on the edge using optimized Qualcomm models:
- **FaceDetLite:** Lightweight Face Detection.
- **FaceAttribNet:** Facial Attribute Detection (detects eye openness and sunglasses).

### 4. Integrated BMS Engine
The battery telemetry stream is scored locally by the following offline ML models:
- **LSTM Battery Fault Classifier:** ONNX runtime inference.
- **Sensor Autoencoder:** ONNX runtime anomaly detection.
- **Isolation Forest:** Scikit-Learn based anomaly fallback.
- **XGBoost Classifier:** Used by the Sensor Trust Engine for accuracy supervision.

## 🏃 Run and Usage Instructions

1. **Start the Edge AI LLM (GenieX):** (See Step 1 in AI Models section above).
2. **Start the Web Dashboard Server:** (See Step 1 above).
3. **Start the BMS Engine:** (See Step 2 above). It will process simulated or real hardware telemetry in real-time.
4. **Access the Dashboard:** Open `http://localhost:3001` or your React frontend URL in a browser. You can interact with the AI assistant, monitor live cell analytics, and view predictive faults all processed locally on the edge.

## 🧪 Tests and Testing Instructions
To verify the setup is working correctly:
1. Ensure the Mosquitto MQTT broker is active (the backend defaults to `ws://test.mosquitto.org:8080`).
2. Start the FastAPI server; it will automatically begin publishing simulated battery telemetry if hardware is not connected.
3. Check the terminal running `run_engine.py`. You should see `AI Diagnostics Result:` printed every second, confirming the edge model is actively scoring the data stream.
4. Open the driver monitor (`monitor.py`) and cover your eyes for 10 frames to test the Qualcomm FaceDetLite drowsiness alert trigger.
